For the faashion district, fabrics, screen-printing screens, sewing machines, scissors, and other tools have been purchased and are being placed in their stations. Cameras, speakers, instruments, tripods, and so on are slowly entering the facility.</p>

        <p>After a year, good progress have been made on the Block building. The different facilities are starting to take shape and they look great. The studios are very spacious and have plenty of room to hold many people. That way, Block will not be overflowed with people. This also allows for artists to collaborate with eachother. Block will never have to worry about reaching the maximum amount of people in the building as there are three floors: bottom, ground, and top. The bottom floor plays an important part as it is the foundation of the structure. The last part of construction that needs to be done are the computer rooms for the digital artists.</p>
